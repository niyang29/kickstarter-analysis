# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose 
* The purpose of this analysis is to compare the campaigns outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals in order to make decisions on how Louise can better prepare for future kickstarter campaigns.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
* Outcome 1: Theatre Kickstarter campaigns, regardless of when it is launched tend to have more successfull campaigns than failed campaigns.
* Outcome 2: The highest total of campaigns are launched in May, total of 166 campaigns, and June, total of 153 campaigns. May has the highest number of successful campaigns of 111 campaigns.  
* Outcome 3: There were approximately the same amount of campaigns that were successful (37) and failed (35) in December. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
* Outcome 1: The highest percentage of successful campaigns are when the goals of the campaigns are less than or equal to $4999. 
* Outcome 2: There tends to be more failed campaigns when the campain goals are greater than $20000. 
* Outcome 3: There were no canceled campaigns. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
*The difficulties I encountered was executing the Countifs function where I had to determine how to filter the different columns within the function. I also realized that I used the incorrect syntax of <,> and = at the wrong place which did not provide me with the correct results. I had to double, triple, quadruple check my formula to see that I had used the wrong sign in the wrong portion of the formula. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Theatre kick starter campaigns tend to have a higher success rate. In order to maximize the success rate of theatre kickstarter campaigns, it is recommended to the campaigns in May and June. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Smaller goals between $0 to $4999 yield a higher rate of successful campaigns than campaigns that are greater than $20,000. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Limitations to Outcomes based on Goals: Does not account for campaigns that are still live. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Possible tables/graphs that we could create: In order to attain more information, we could also review which campaigns are more successful base off of the varying countries.
